# GW Classic Systems

More multi-planet, multi-spawn systems from earlier versions of Galactic War.

Replaces both classic and titans with the same set of classic systems.

Not changed: easy systems on Normal difficulty, and faction 'boss' systems.

Note: systems are set when the galaxy is generated, so the mod will affect games started while it is enabled. It won't affect games in progress, and disabling the mod won't turn it off for games already generated.
